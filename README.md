# ServeBot
### Here to Serve
My first attempt at making a discord bot written in discord.js / Node.
Soon to be open for public use.

The bot is very basic | Constantly Trying out and adding new commands.

Default Prefix is: ! (Adding ability to change prefix)

Currently Features:
```
> Help
> Hello
> Avatar
> Owner
> Server
> Purge
> Donate
> Flip
> Roll
> RandomNumber
```
